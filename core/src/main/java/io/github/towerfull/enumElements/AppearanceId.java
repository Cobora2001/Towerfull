 * An enumeration of all appearance IDs used in the game.
 * These IDs are used to identify different visual elements such as mobs, towers, backgrounds, and special locations.
 * It is generally an union of all the IDs that need an appearance in the game, given that we don't reuse appearances
 * for different element types (e.g., a goblin will never have the same appearance as a tower).
